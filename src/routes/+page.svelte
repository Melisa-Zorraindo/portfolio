					I absolutely love creating smooth user experiences and crafting awesome IT solutions!
					Solving complex problems is my jam, and I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with
					others. As a developer, I take great pride in delivering top-notch work and ensuring the
					highest quality. During my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience in building
					web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My focus? Making them responsive
					and accessible to everyone. Let's create something amazing together!
